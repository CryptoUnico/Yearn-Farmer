## Installations

To run this project locally you need to deploy USDT, yEarn, yVault and this repo, Yearn-Farmer. 

1. `npm install` -g truffle`
2. `npm install`
3. Run a local Ganache Project. Take note of the Server Port and Network ID, as they will be needed for all deployments. 
4. Deploy USDT locally:
    1. cd into the project
    2. `npm install`
    3. In the ``truffle-config.js``:
        1. Uncomment only the development object and replace values with your own from Ganache
    4. `truffle compile`
    5. `truffle migrate --network development`
    6. For the contract migration “TetherToken”, save the value for the key “contract address” as we need that for later
5. Deploy yEarn locally: 
    1. `npm install`
    2. In the `truffle-config.js`:
        1. Uncomment only the development object and replace values with your own from Ganache
    3. Open the file /contracts/yEarn.sol and replace the address on line:389 with the USDT contract address you saved in an earlier step
    4. `truffle compile`
    5. `truffle migrate --network development`
    6. For the contract migration “yUSDT”, save the value for the key “contract address” as we need that for later
6. Deploy yVault locally: 
    1. `npm install`
    2. In the `truffle-config.js`:
        1. Uncomment only the development object and replace values with your own from Ganache
    1. Open the file /migrations/1_initial_migration.js and replace the 1st address on line:12 with the USDT contract address you saved in an earlier step. Ignore the 2nd address
    2. `truffle compile`
    3. `truffle migrate --network development`
    4. For the contract migration “yVault”, save the value for the key “contract address” as we need that for later
7. Change the parameters of the smart contract addresses on the migrations file.
9. `truffle compile`
10. `truffle migrate --network development`
